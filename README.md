# Raycaster-Maze-Game
One of my first graphics projects in C++ where I built a raycaster which renders a randomly generated maze using a custom algorithm all in realtime. 

Uses SDL for sound and OpenGL to render. The maze is generated using a semi custom backtracking algorithm. Text is drawn using my less than ideal approach of drawing lines.
